## 🎯 Project Overview

### What We're Building
A production-grade automated trading bot for Binance Spot/Futures featuring:
- **Three-System Ensemble:** UP (bullish), DOWN (bearish), NEUTRAL (mean-reversion)
- **Adaptive Learning:** Weekly weight updates based on performance
- **Dynamic Risk Management:** Multi-level drawdown brakes (-5%, -10%, -15%)
- **Full State Persistence:** Crash recovery via SQLite
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Closes all positions on exit

### Key Innovation
The bot **self-optimizes** by analyzing its own trading performance and adjusting:
- Feature weights (which indicators to trust more)
- System weights (which trading system is performing best)
- Confidence calibration (based on historical win rates)

## 💰 Budget Summary

| Phase | Milestones | Duration | Cost |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Phase A** | M1-M3 | 5 weeks | $10,000 |
| **Phase B** | M4-M6 | 6.5 weeks | $13,000 |

## 🔒 Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Binance API Breaking Changes**
   - Mitigation: Use official library, version pinning

2. **Client Approval Delays**
   - Mitigation: Clear KPI definitions, async approval

3. **Adaptive Learning Underperforms**
   - Mitigation: Fallback to heuristic weights

### Technical Safeguards
- Pre-trade leverage checks (hard cap at 6.0x)
- Multi-level drawdown brakes
- Graceful shutdown (never leaves naked positions)
- Full state persistence (crash recovery)
- Comprehensive logging (audit trail)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Always Test on Testnet First**
   - All development uses Testnet (testnet: true in config)
   - Production requires explicit flag change + separate API keys

2. **Never Commit Credentials**
   - API keys in config.json (gitignored)
   - Use environment variables or secure vault

3. **Graceful Shutdown Only**
   - Always use Ctrl+C for shutdown
   - Never kill process without closing positions

4. **Monitor Logs Regularly**
   - Daily log files in `logs/bot_YYYY-MM-DD.log`
   - Use `jq` for JSON log parsing
