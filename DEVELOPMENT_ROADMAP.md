   - UP/DOWN/NEUTRAL systems
   - Feature calculation & normalization
   - Initial weight calculation (correlation-based)

   - Performance-calibrated confidence
   - Multi-level drawdown brakes
   - CME gap & weekend volatility handling
   - 72-hour full integration test
   - **Deliverable:** Complete, self-optimizing trading bot

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Adaptive learning improves performance over 7 days
- ✅ Drawdown brakes trigger at -5%, -10%, -15%
- ✅ 72-hour run with zero critical errors
- ✅ Strategy adapts to changing market conditions

## Key Dependencies & Assumptions

### Client Responsibilities
1. **Week 1:** Provide Binance Testnet API credentials (Spot + Futures enabled)
2. **Week 3:** Fund Testnet account with ≥10,000 USDT
3. **Each Milestone:** Review and approve within 2 business days of KPI demonstration
4. **Week 12:** (Optional) Provide production API keys for live deployment

### Technical Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Internet connection (stable, low latency preferred)
- Operating system: Windows 10+, Linux, or macOS
- Hardware: 4GB RAM, 10GB disk space, dual-core CPU

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Client approval delays | Schedule slip | Clear KPI definitions, async approval | PM |
| Binance API breaking changes | Major rework | Use official library, version pinning | Dev |
| Adaptive learning underperforms | Strategy failure | Fallback to heuristic weights, manual tuning | Dev |

### Medium-Risk Items
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Testnet API instability | Testing delays | Use mainnet for non-trading tests | Dev |
| Scope creep | Budget overrun | Strict adherence to spec, approval gates | PM |
| Exchange rate limits | Reduced throughput | Pre-calculate weight, implement queuing | Dev |
