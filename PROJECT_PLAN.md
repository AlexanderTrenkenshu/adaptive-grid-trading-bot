## Development Principles

### 1. **Robustness First**
- All network operations must have retry logic
- State must be persisted before execution
- Never leave naked positions on crash

### 2. **Exchange Compliance**
- Respect rate limits (1200 weight/minute for Binance)
- Use LIMIT orders over MARKET where possible to reduce fees
- Implement exponential backoff on errors

### 3. **Risk Management**
- Pre-trade check on EVERY order
- Real-time leverage monitoring
- Multi-level drawdown brakes

### 4. **Testability**
- All modules must be testable in isolation
- Testnet validation required before live deployment
- 48-hour continuous run requirement

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Requirements
✅ Zero unhandled exceptions during 72-hour run
✅ WebSocket reconnection within 60 seconds of disconnect
✅ State recovery after forced shutdown
✅ Leverage cap never exceeded
✅ All orders logged with full context

### Business Requirements
✅ Configurable without code changes
✅ Graceful shutdown closes all positions
✅ Accurate PnL calculation (fees + funding)
✅ Adaptive learning improves performance over time
✅ Multi-symbol portfolio support

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Exchange API changes | High | Use official library, implement version checks |
| WebSocket disconnections | High | Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff |
| Order modification failures | Medium | Fallback to cancel+replace |
| Database corruption | High | Write-ahead logging, periodic backups |
| Clock skew | Medium | Use exchange server time |

### Trading Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Flash crash | High | Stop-loss with conviction decay |
| Stuck positions | Medium | Drawdown brakes at -5%, -10%, -15% |
| Over-leveraging | Critical | Pre-trade leverage check (hard limit) |
| Fee leakage | Medium | LIMIT orders, proximity-based cancellation |
| Funding rate bleeding | Medium | Funding gradient in system scoring |

## Appendix A: Key Formulas

### Conviction Calculation
```python
L = (w1 * b_up * c_up) + (w2 * max(b_neu, 0) * c_neu)
S = (v1 * -b_down * c_down) + (v2 * min(b_neu, 0) * c_neu)
```

### Dynamic Order Size
```python
long_size = base_order_size * (1 + size_mult * L + imb_mult * imbalance) / (1 + vol_mult * volatility_factor)
```

### Grid Spacing
```python
long_spacing = baseline_spacing * (1 + vol_mult * vol_factor) / (1 + 0.5 * L + 0.4 * imbalance)
# Clamped between spacing_clamp_min * ATR and spacing_clamp_max * ATR
```

### Take-Profit Distance
```python
tp_distance = long_spacing * (1 + tp_conviction_mult * L)
# Capped at tp_cap_multiplier * initial_tp_distance
```
